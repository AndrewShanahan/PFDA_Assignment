# Programming for Data Analysis<br>

## PfDA Assignment 1 - README<br>

### Introduction - about the Project and Readme file

This repository has been created as part of the course work for the Programming for Data Analysis module in the Higher Diploma in Computer Programming in Data Analytics provided by Atlantic Technical University.<br>

### Purspose<br>

This repository has been created and edit by way of using jupyter notebooks.<br>

This project analyses data from an Airbnb dataset for Dublin, Ireland and analysis statistical analysis on certain variables in addition to similar analysis on a synthesised dataset. To get started, the notebook is found in the following link and contains all the analysis for this project; https://github.com/AndrewShanahan/PFDA_Assignment/blob/main/PfDA_Assignment.ipynb<br>

The references section below may be of use to users in order to help with understanding of project.

### System Requirments<br>

To run or modify the notebooks on a local machine requires the latest version of Python, Anaconda is an easy to use version available on Windows, Mac or Linux operating systems. Alternatively there are a number of web based version available like Jupyter Notebooks which has been ultilised during this project.<br>

In formation on how to install and run jupyter notebooks can be found through the following link:<br>
